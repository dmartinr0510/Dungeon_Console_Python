## Description

**Dungeon Console Python** is a text-based role-playing game (RPG) developed entirely in Python. The project aims to recreate the essence of classic adventure games where the player must navigate through dungeons, face enemies, and manage resources—all through a clean and efficient console interface.

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), game logic, and state management in Python without the need for external graphical libraries.

## Key Features

* **Dungeon Exploration:** Navigation through different levels or rooms generated [procedurally](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/procedural-dungeon-generation-algorithm).
* **Combat System:** Turn-based encounters against various types of enemies.
* **Inventory System:** Access to an inventory of items found throughout the journey.
* **Text Interface:** Retro ASCII/Text-based design for a nostalgic experience.

## Prerequisites

To run this project on **LINUX**, you must have **Python 3.6** or higher installed on your system. Download the file from the last [release](https://github.com/dmartinr0510/Dungeon_Console_Python/releases) and grant execution permissions using:

```bash
chmod +x DungeonsGame
```
To run this project on **WINDOWS**, simply download the`.exe` file from the latest  [release](https://github.com/dmartinr0510/Dungeon_Console_Python/releases).
# Controls

The game is controlled via the keyboard.

|   Key / Command    | Action                                                           |
|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` | **Movement** through the map (North, West, South, East).         |
|        `i`         | Open the **Inventory**.                                          |

## Project Structure

The code is organized modularly to separate game logic, entities, and the interface.
